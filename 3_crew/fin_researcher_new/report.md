**Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Comprehensive Report**

**Executive Summary**

Tesla remains the largest pure-play EV manufacturer by revenue and market influence, with a major manufacturing footprint in China, Germany, and the US. The company delivered record top-line growth in 2024-2025, with full-year 2024 revenue of $96.044 billion and GAAP net income of $3.689 billion.
